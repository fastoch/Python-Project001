# Making a text-based slot machine  
The user will deposit a certain amount of money. 
We will then allow him to bet on either one, two, or three lines of the slot machine.
If he wins (by getting any of the lines he bet on), we multiply his bet by the value of the line, add that to his balance, 
and allow him to keep playing until he wanna cash out or until he runs out of money.
